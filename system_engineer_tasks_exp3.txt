### Notes:
- The tasks are structured to cover the entire lifecycle of the system architecture, from planning and requirements gathering to design, integration, testing, and documentation.
- Time estimates are based on typical productivity rates for system engineering tasks and may vary based on team experience and project complexity.
- The rework tasks account for potential defects identified during reviews and meetings, which is common in system engineering processes.
